        <br>
        <code>
            1. We created a file called <strong>bibliography.bib</strong> and added the label, author, title, year, journal, volume,
            number and pages of the article we wanted to cite into it. Then we use the <strong>cite</strong> command in our LaTeX file
            to cite the article. Then, we needed to add <strong>bibliographystyle</strong> and <strong>bibliography</strong> into our document. Finally,
            the TeX compiled our LaTeX document, which needed to be compiled four times.
            <br>
            2. We learned how to set the document style to that of the IEEE and use the IEEE bibliography style. And we
            learned how to include the actual source code from a program in our LaTeX document using the listings package.

        This part will intro some basic knowledge about BibTeX:
        <br>
        <code>
            <strong>booktitle:</strong> the title of the book, if only part of it is being cited.
            <br>
            <strong>journal:</strong> the journal or magazine the work was published in.
            <br>
            <strong>volume:</strong> the volume of a journal or multi-volume book. <br>
            <strong>number:</strong> the issue number of a journal, magazine, or tech-report, if applicable.

        <h3>Learning and thinking</h3>

    <div class="c1">
        This part mainly includes the significance of what I have learned for the future development, as well as my reflection:
        <br>

        <code>1. Using BibTeX for referencing is useful for our later academic report. <br>
            2. The advantage of this material is that it is easy to understand and we can quickly learn how to
            use BibTeX in our document. The weak point is that the exercises of different citation types are less.
            Therefore, we need more practice in our daily LaTeX writing.</code>

    \section{Introduce to Machine Learing}

    In section 2 we discuss the Statistical Query Model, our summation form framework and an example \cite{396988}
    of its application. In section 3 we describe how our framework may be implemented in a Googlelike map-reduce paradigm. In section 4 we choose 10 frequently used machine learning algorithms
    as examples of what can be coded in this framework. \cite{199317} This is followed by experimental runs on 10
    moderately large data sets in section 5, where we show a good match to our theoretical computational
    complexity results. Basically, we often achieve linear speedup in the number of cores. Section 6
    concludes the paper \cite{10.1257/jep.31.2.87}
